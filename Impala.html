      <p class="about">
        A "charged" version of the <strong>Chevrolet Impala</strong> was
        released: the <b>SS427</b> (SS = Super Sport) Impala, it had the largest
        engine in the third generation of the Impala (427 335bhp-425bhp Turbo
        Jet V8), was a two-door and cost over $5000 at the time, making it one
        of the most expensive cars of the time (no other Impala could compare in
        value with the SS427), and the only thing that distinguished the SS427
        from the usual "family" Impalas in appearance were the "SS" and "427"
        badges on the trunk and fenders. The Impala SS is considered the car
        that ushered in the era of muscle cars.
