        <p class="about">
          A "charged" version of the <strong>Chevrolet Impala</strong> was
          released: the <b>SS427</b> (SS = Super Sport) Impala, it had the
          largest engine in the third generation of the Impala (427
          335bhp-425bhp Turbo Jet V8), was a two-door and cost over $5000 at the
          time, making it one of the most expensive cars of the time (no other
          Impala could compare in value with the SS427), and the only thing that
          distinguished the SS427 from the usual "family" Impalas in appearance
          were the "SS" and "427" badges on the trunk and fenders. The Impala SS
          is considered the car that ushered in the era of muscle cars.
